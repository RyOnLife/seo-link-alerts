# SEO Link Alerts #

If sites are reviewing and linking to the products of your competitors, they'll probably review and link to you too.

* Set up a Google Alert for each of your competitors, and add the RSS feed to SEO Link Alerts.
* It'll scrape the pages that triggered the alert, looking for legit (e.g. no `rel=nofollow` links and some other criteria) and organize the good ones for you to take action on.

We had excellent success getting links by just reaching out to sites surfaced by this tool, and asking them to consider reviewing our product, a web-based accounting app for small businesses.
